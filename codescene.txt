[SCENE START]

(Dark screen, flickering cursor effect in GREEN)
> System Check... OK
> Secure Channel... ESTABLISHED
> Location... Unknown Datastream

(Faint BLUE lines trace network paths across the screen)

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server, calm but urgent, perhaps CYAN text):
"Ranger... can you hear me? The network is unstable. Interference... strong."
"Something big just happened. Project Chimera... it's gone dark."

(Screen flashes RED briefly. ASCII depiction of fragmented data streams.)

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server):
"Chimera wasn't just data; it was... potential. A new way to link minds, knowledge... safely. Or so we thought."
"The Fog... they ripped it out. Not just deleted. *Excised*."
"Worse... they left a signature. An old one. One I haven't seen in years."

(A complex, glitchy ASCII symbol flashes - the Shadow Admin's mark - perhaps MAGENTA)

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server):
"He's back. Or... someone using his methods. The Shadow Admin."
"He believes information *must* be chaotic, uncontrolled. He thinks we're building cages."
"We built Chimera to connect; he'll twist it to divide."

(ASCII art: A stylized globe with RED 'infection' points spreading.)

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server):
"The fragments of Chimera are scattered, hidden within complex digital systems worldwide. They're the 'artifacts' now."
"Shadow Admin is hunting them too. If he reassembles Chimera with his own... modifications... it could destabilize global networks. Total information anarchy."
"Your credentials... they're still valid. Your old rig... I've uploaded the latest trace protocols."

(ASCII art: A simple representation of the Player's 'rig' or console.)

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server):
"You're the only one with the background, the skills... the history... to understand how he thinks."
"Find the artifacts. Secure them. Build countermeasures using the very cloud technologies he exploits."
"Track him. Stop him. Before he plunges the world into digital shadows."

(Prompt appears in YELLOW)
Enter Your Ranger Handle: [INPUT]

VOICE (Dr. Aurora Server):
"Good luck, [Player Name]. The trail starts in Neo-Kyoto... where the first fragment vanished."
"Watch your back. The Fog is everywhere. And he... he remembers you."
